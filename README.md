# Data Drive (Backend) 📝 📦
## Take a look of the code base of the this MVP (MERN). 
This is a REST API implemented with Express / MongoDB / Google API / Passport.

The problem that this app solves?
At work I am required to create templates on google drive, update the placeholders and download a pdf with the updated version... To much right? I decided to write an app that automates this process for me 🧠

## Extra Info 👀
I was motivated to build this project because I wanted to speed up my work's pipeline. I work as a technology coordinator and I am required to create and share a lot of pdf that most of the time come from a "premade template". I thought it was going to be cool to automate this process and use it for my daily work. ⚡️
